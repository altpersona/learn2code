The purpose of the Tutor script is enable practice coding.

Running the script looks like `./tutor file.txt`

The script reads a text file. Print line by line the files contents, prompts for user input for each line,
compares each user input to the read line from the file and reprompts on discrepency. 

The function goals for the script.

Read file :$1 basically does this.

Stop at end of refference file: unresovled, idk if its an actual problem.
print lines from the file : While IPS seems to do this.

Print line from file to screen : Printf is working

Read user input : read is not working as is.

Check input vs file content : idk if working or not.

optional : count number of retries and give error count.
